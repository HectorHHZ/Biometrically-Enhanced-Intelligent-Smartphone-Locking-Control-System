# Biometrically-Enhanced-Intelligent-Smartphone-Locking-Control-System

This product aims to improve existing products in the market.(Intelligent lock using biometrics authentication) 
Through investigation, I found that biometric locks on sale in the market are expensive and insecure. Those locks put biometrics authentication
on the hardware, which is expensive(more than 2000 RMB). Besides, they are not convenienve at all, since each time guests come, the host
must put their biometrics information on the lock and delete them after guests leave. The right access process is complicated.

So our team design an intelligent locking control system combining smartphone, hardware lock, and biometric features. With our products, users can not only use their biological characteristics, the APP and the specific phone to unlock doors but also authorize the access right and access time to visitors readily. We put the biometrics authentication on the smartphone, this offered people more convenience and security as well as lowered the cost to 15%. The host can give the access right to everyone he likes by cliking button on his phone, and delete the right whenever he like. The host can also limit the time guests can open the door.

This repository contains all of code for the Android application. The code for hardware(STM32F/ Arduino) is not released. If you want to see the integral application, you can go to another repository and download the ZIP file directly.
